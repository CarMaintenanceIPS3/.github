## Getting Started

To get started with our application, clone the [CarMaintenanceDockerSetup](https://github.com/CarMaintenanceIPS3/CarMaintenanceDockerSetup.git) repository, as well as the [fauna_db_api](https://github.com/CarMaintenanceIPS3/fauna_db_api.git) and [NextJS](https://github.com/CarMaintenanceIPS3/NextJS.git) repositories, into the same parent directory. Then, follow the instructions in the [CarMaintenanceDockerSetup README](https://github.com/CarMaintenanceIPS3/CarMaintenanceDockerSetup/blob/main/README.md) to build and run the application.

## Project Roadmap

### *Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Features (Current Phase 🔥)*
- Setup the project repositories and Docker configuration.
- Develop the basic .NET Core API and Next.js frontend.
- Implement user authentication and roles (owners and service providers).
- Allow owners to input their vehicle information (brand, model, year, VIN).
- Allow owners to input their maintenance tasks (oil changes, tire rotations, brake replacements) and costs.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Add the ability for owners to store invoices for maintenance services.
- Develop a feature that allows service providers to add services if they have access.
- Develop a feature that shows recommended maintenance based on vehicle information.

### Phase 3: Extended Functionality
- Implement a cost tracking system where users can see an overview of all costs related to their car's maintenance.
- Allow users to add custom maintenance tasks that are specific to their own cars.

### Phase 4: User Interface and Experience Enhancements
- Improve the frontend to provide a better user experience.
- Implement a feature to provide a timeline of future maintenance tasks.

### Phase 5: Testing, Documentation, and Deployment
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure the application runs smoothly and securely.
- Making sure all documentation of the application usage and API endpoints is easy to understand and use.
- Deploy the application for public use.
